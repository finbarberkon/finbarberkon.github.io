<h1>Finbar's Tutor feedback form</h1>
<p>Because I'm only a lab assistant this term, I don't show up on your myExperience surveys. But I would still love to get feedback from my students so that I can become a better tutor for next term! So, please give me some feedback below if you have the time.</p>
<p>The form is completely anonymous using https://usebasin.com to capture the input and email it to me.</p>
<p>Thank you so much! :)</p>
<form accept-charset="UTF-8" action="https://usebasin.com/f/867217b0dc77" enctype="multipart/form-data" method="POST">
  <textarea rows="4" cols="50" name="comment" required>
  </textarea>
